# ToDo list app

Super-useful ~~another~~ ToDo list app with React. It consumes data from an API made with Node.js + MongoDB ([here](https://github.com/mariogl/todo-list-api)).

Note I: Please make sure you use this app for doing good.

Note II: No counter button tutorials have been followed to develop this app.
